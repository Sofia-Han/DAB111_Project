# Final Project Group 14 - DAB 111 (Introduction To Python Programming) - St. Clair College

## Project Goals
For this Final Project submission, students were required to create a simple website containing data from a pre-selected dataset and display it in a repository on Github.

## About The Code
The code presented in the database_code.ipynb is responsible for creating the database "Udemy" using SQLite library, by extracting information from a csv file and storing it in a table named "courses".

The code presented in the app_code.py creates a website where data stored in the database "Udemy" is displayed in an orginized way. It runs the html files with scripts for the construction of the pages.
