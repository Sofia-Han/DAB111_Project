# Final Project Group 14 - DAB 111 (Introduction To Python Programming) - St. Clair College

## Project Goals
For this Final Project submission, students were required to create a simple website containing data from a pre-selected dataset and create a repository on Github.

## About The Code
In the database folder, it can be found 4 files: An app.py file (responsible for creating the website and inserting data from the database on it), a database_code.ipynb (responsible for creating the database in SQLite from a csv file), the database itself (named Udemy) and a templates folder containing the html scripts used by the app to create the website pages.
